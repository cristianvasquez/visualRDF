# Introduction
visualRDF aims to provide a lightweight graphical visualization of an RDF graph.

This is a fork of alangrafu's visualRDF[1] that only uses Javascript.

You can test this using 

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888

Once this is running, go to: 
http://localhost:8888/index.html

visualRDF uses d3.js[2]
